# **The Monkees **

## **User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project**

    This is an informative website about The Monkees band where you can listen to a few songs, read some information about the band
    and get in contact with them.

## **Wireframe**

    Tried to stick to the original idea, but made some minor changes during the 
    building of the page.

## **User experience**

    My goal was to create an easily understandable website with colors which are easy for the eye, solid and elegant. This site is mostly for 
    older people so I tried to make it as simple as possible.
    
## **Technologies**
    
    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3. Bootstrap (4.2)
    4. Font Awesome
    
## **Testing**

    The site was tested on many devices from mobile phones, 50" TV, Ipad to ensure it's working correctly on all devices.
    It respondes to all screen sizes.
    All links open in a new tab.

## **Deployment**

    The site is hosted by GitHub pages you can visit it here: https://digergo.github.io/monkees/ .
    
## **Content**

    About the band I took information from Wikipeadia.
    Pictures, videos and music was given from Code Institute.
    The rest of the content was written by me, most of the information is made up.
    
    Most of the code was reused from my previous websites tailored to fit this site's needs.
